# prework-study-guide

## A place where I can make notes to help me through bootcamp.

- My motivation is to keep track of different concepts and tools that I read but might not immediately absorb. 
- Building this project was a fun way of incorporating Git, CSS, HTML and JS for the first time while also building a practical note taking environment. 
- This solves the problem of having notes being kept in a variety of places that could get confusing. 
- The skills I learned in this process, were the basics of the aforementioned tools for coding, and some of the mindset/skills needed for problem solving and critical thinking.
